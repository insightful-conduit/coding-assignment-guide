## FAQ

There is a general [FAQ available](../faq.md).

#### Does my submission have to look like the example?

No. This example uses a simple [CSS utility framework](https://bulma.io/).

Your submission should meet the display criteria. Your look and feel can be minimal or as advanced as you like. This is _not_ a design assignment, however, your submission should look reasonable.
